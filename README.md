# CSC522ProjectCode
The code to be run is "Matlab\LocalizedEigenfeatures\testLocalizedEigenFeatures",

This will return a result in the form

t_1_1, t_1_2 ..... t_1_10, t_1_avg;
t_2_1, t_2_2 ..... t_2_10, t_2_avg;
:       :              :          :
t_n_1, t_n_2 ..... t_n_10, t_n_avg;

Where t_i_j is the purity of the jth digit in the ith test. 

Setting can be adjusted by editing the Config vars. 

Significant amount of the functionality is ad hoc and requries direct commenting or editing of code as this was not written to be a mature library.
